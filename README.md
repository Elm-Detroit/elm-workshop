# Introduction to Elm (Workshop)

Elm is a functional programming language for front-end web development. Elm has been gaining popularity as it aims to 
solve many of the main pain points of the modern JavaScript developer.

In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the Elm programming language and will build a small Elm app from 
the ground up. We assume prior knowledge only of JavaScript or another imperative or object-oriented language.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

-  Build an working Elm web app

To achieve that goal, we will cover:

#### Syntax

Participants will learn about Elm's syntax and core data structures. We’ll also compare Elm’s syntax to JavaScript.

#### The Elm Architecture

We’ll learn about Elm’s built in architecture and how it eliminates the need for a separate framework.

#### Data Modelling

Participants will learn about (and implement) Elm data structures to model their application.

#### Working with back-end JSON APIs

Here participants will add connectivity to their app by sending a request to the app’s API and processing the response. 
We'll also learn about how JSON decoders and encoders are used to transform and process JSON data to and from concrete Elm
data structures.

#### Displaying Data
 
In this section, participants will learn about how to create "View" code that displays their data on the screen.

#### Handling User Interaction with Messages
 
In this section, we'll finish creating our app by wiring up event handling for our app's user interaction. 

#### Next Steps and Questions and Answers

In the final section, we'll briefly cover some things that are important but are out of the scope of the initial workshop such as:

- Interop with JavaScript
- Elm's Compiler
- Adding visual feedback for "loading", "success", "error" states etc.
- Using libraries like elm-bootstrap to simplify the development process
- Embedding an Elm app into an existing page/app
- Techniques for scaling
- Passing in flags upon app start up
- Testing in Elm

### Requirements

For this class, you will need to bring and prepare:

- A laptop with internet access (we'll have WiFi access at the events)

- A GitHub account <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a>

- A way to quickly clone GitHub repos (command line, SourceTree, GitHub Desktop, etc.)
  
  git installers: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>

### Setup 

Before the workshop, you'll want to make sure that your environment and project are setup.
