# Introduction to Elm (Part 1)

## What is Elm?

- Functional language for the browser
- Strongly and statically typed
- Compiles to JavaScript
- ML style language, written in Haskell
- Declarative syntax

##### From the guide...
> Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.

##### Some properties that have made Elm and solid choice for the front-end development  
- A beginner friendly language with a minimal but powerful set of features
- A quick and kind compiler that provides type inference
- Advertises “No” runtime exceptions
- An architecture designed for the language
- Fully interoperable with JavaScript
- Enforces semantic versioning
- A helpful and friendly community
- A formatter that eliminates the need for a linter
